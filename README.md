# üè• Multi-Label Chest X-Ray Diagnosis with Grad-CAM

A deep learning project for **multi-label classification** of chest X-ray images to detect **14 common thoracic pathologies**.  
Built with a pre-trained **DenseNet121** model, the project also provides **Grad-CAM visualizations** for interpretability.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Multi-Label Classification**  
  Identifies up to 14 distinct pathologies in a single image  
  *(e.g., Cardiomegaly, Effusion, Pneumonia)*.

- **Class Imbalance Handling**  
  Implements custom weighted binary cross-entropy loss based on calculated class frequencies to improve performance on rare diseases.

- **Transfer Learning**  
  Utilizes a pre-trained DenseNet121 CNN architecture for robust feature extraction.

- **Model Interpretability (XAI)**  
  Generates Grad-CAM heatmaps to visualize the regions of the X-ray image the model focuses on for each pathology prediction.

- **Performance Evaluation**  
  Reports Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) for each class, a robust metric for imbalanced data.
